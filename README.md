# MATLAB to Julia

The purpose of this repo is to host a [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/pbouffard/matlabtojulia/wiki) which provides a place to capture information that could be helpful for people interested in migrating code from [MATLABâ„¢](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to [Julia](https://julialang.org), and also those who are familiar with MATLAB and would like to learn Julia. It is meant to supplement existing resources, for instance the differences page from the Julia documentation. However this wiki intends to be more comprehensive, and to be structured in such a way as to make it easy for one to find answers to questions like:

* For a given MATLAB or MATLAB toolbox command/function/construct what are the closest Julia equivalents?
* For a given MATLAB toolbox, what Julia packages provide similar functionality?

In other words, the wiki captures the most salient information that one might find by [searching for something like "julia equivalent of matlab `ones`"](https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=julia%20equivalent%20to%20matlab%20ones).
